A small d√¶mon that reads X11 events (typically generated by the xkbbell command), translate and routes them into Growl notifications. The code currently only runs on Mac OS X. Features:

* Send notifications from any Unix system with X11 installed.
* Notification volume gets translated into notification priority.
* Source hostname is automatically extracted and added to the message.
* If a X11 window identity is specified, window title and icon are used for the notification.
